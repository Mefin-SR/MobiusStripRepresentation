# MobiusStripRepresentation

Structure of Code
1. Initialized the class with given parameters radius, width and number of points, then computed its 3D coordinates(using numpy library) using the parametric equation of mobius strip using the function _compute_surface().
2. The methods compute_surface_area() and compute_edge_length() calculates the area and edge length of mobius strip using approximation formula.
3. plot() methods plots the 3D graph(using matplotlib package) of the mobius strip with the computed coordinates.


Surface Area Approximation
  Since the edge of mobius strip is a circle and it is a 2D shape, we can calculate the surface area by mutiplying its width with the edge of the circle.
  Edge length of mobius strip is two times the edge length of the circle because it consist of circle at its both end.


Learned a lot about mobius strip ^_^ and it is fun challenge for learning new things.
